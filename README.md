# Univariate_Linear_Regression
This model finds the fitting linear regression plot for a given set of scattered points.
The model doesn't use the standard available procedures for computing stochastic gradient descent and updating the parameters, instead it uses functions that i have made and updates the parameters manually for a given hyperparameter, i.e. the learning rate.
The cost function's value's movement towards the minimum has been shown in each iteration.
